/** The middleware layer.
 *
 * This simple middleware layer will allow to have a simple way to configure
 * and define all the application interaction.
 *
 * Indeed, to communicate applications need the destination adress.
 * This could be achieved by settings in each application, all the
 * addresses of all the applications though a configuration file.
 *
 * However this would be very hard to maintain. So intead, this middleware
 * layer will be for now a simple directory, in which, each application will
 * be registered at start-up.
 *
 * Every application will have a local copy of this directory, in order to
 * synchronously get the address of any other application.
 *
 * This approach is not really reliable, a more effective approach would
 * be to have a consensuce algorithm as RAFT to register each application.
